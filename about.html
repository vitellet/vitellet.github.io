	  <h4>About:</h4>
	  <p>I am a Software Engineer based in Southern California. I have my BS in Computer Science. I enjoy working on projects and platforms across all industries. I built this website as a way to showcase my projects/interest in technology.</p>
	  
	  <br>
	  <h4>My Story:</h4>	
	  <p>As a child I had a very limited interaction with computers. I always enjoyed using computers, but I never thought of them as more than just a means of productivity or personal enjoyment. As I grew up my interest in technology was flourished by the mass production of mobile phones. I was interested in how they worked, but more importantly how they could bring the worlds information right into the palm of your hand. At this time, I was still unsure what I wanted to do as a career, but the rapid increase in consumer electronics interested me. I decided to enroll in school to pursue a degree in Computer Science, as this was a great opportunity for me to see how this technology worked.</p>
		
	  <p>While in school my perception of computers changed drastically. As I learned how computers processed data and interacted with one another, I realized there was far more to technology than I knew as a consumer. This new found understanding of technology led to a greater interest in the world of programming. I enjoyed programming because the possibilities are limitless. At the rate of technological growth, computers and programmers can do almost anything they set their mind to. Since I am someone who doesn’t like complacency, programming was something I took to relatively quickly. I couldn’t wait to dive right into a project, just to figure out how it worked and why it does what it does. </p>
	  
	  <p>My interest in programming, paired with the curriculum for computer science, led me to take classes of varying topics. These classes included:
		<ul>
			<li>Machine Architecture, where I implemented and tested a MIPS pipeline Datapath in Verilog</li>
			<li>Operating Systems, where we learned shell programming, thread programming, and using semaphores</li>
			<li>Software Engineering, where as a team we designed and implemented an iOS and Android mobile application for the schools SOAR program</li>
			<li>Machine Learning, where as a team we implemented an image processor that would find positive images in a data set</li>
			<li>Theory of Computation, where I dealt with computers in an abstract form, examining the types of abstract machines needed to solve various problems.</li>
		</ul>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>Upon graduation I landed a position with MyHealth, a startup company based in Southern California. As a member of this team, I am responsible for the software design, user interface, and programming of the company’s mobile applications. I have learned a lot from my experience working with a startup company. It is truly a 24/7 job, there is never a dull moment. This experience has been grueling but very rewarding. Each day is a chance to do something great, I have been able to witness an idea drawn out on paper become software that can help improve the lives of millions of people. Being a part of a startup company is great in lots of different ways, it gave me the ability to dive into software without any boundaries and help form the project from what the founder had originally pictured to what it has become today; and it has given me the opportunity to step out of my comfort zone, speaking with doctors and working with the founder to pitch the software to investors. </p>
	  
	  <p>Although my experience with MyHealth has been focused on mobile application development; I enjoy working with a variety of different languages. I wanted to put together this website as an opportunity to showcase some of my projects and bring all my interests in technology into a central hub. While working on this website I have been using Dreamweaver, which is an amazing tool for web development, bringing HTML5 and Bootstrap together very seamlessly. I have been working with JavaScript and an open-source framework called NativeScript to help build native iOS and Android applications. I enjoy learning about new tools, frameworks, and languages; so, I am always trying out something new. I hope this gave some good insight into who I am, and why I built this website. Feel free to contact me and enjoy!</p>
